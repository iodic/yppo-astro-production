Do you see a problem or series of problems that could jeopardize your team’s project but are worried about how your manager will respond if you speak up?

Too often, organizations are stuck in a culture of fear that prevents teams from reaching their full potential and ultimately hinders the organization’s overall impact. The ability to speak freely and openly, to share your thoughts and ideas, and to voice your concerns and identify problems without the fear of consequences is critical to business success.
