### Intro

__Sexual harassment__ refers to unwelcome sexual conduct, such as unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other verbal, nonverbal, or physical conduct of a sexual nature.

Sexual harassment can cause unspeakable suffering to those involved, whether the victim, or, in the case of a misguided accusation, the accused.

__In extreme cases of harassment or if you feel you are in danger, you should immediately seek the help of third parties, including the authorities.__

Otherwise, data show that in a fair number of cases misunderstandings might be at play.

If you have reason to believe there might be a __misunderstanding__, or in any event you feel like trying to deal with the situation first without third-party help, the following information presents scenarios and available options, with pros and cons.

__None of the following scenarios may match exactly your situation.__ Also note, the circumstances of your situation may be unique or unusual.

__In general, there is no one-size-fits-all solution in human interactions.__

Still, see if any of these examples might help you decide how best to handle the situation.
